1. Introduction
This document provides the low-level design details for the Speech Recognition and Sentiment Analysis application. It includes descriptions of system components, their interactions, and the detailed design for each component.

2. System Overview
The system allows users to input sentences, performs sentiment analysis on the input, and provides feedback on whether the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative. It utilizes Flask for the backend, speech recognition for input, and sentiment analysis using TextBlob.

3. Components
Web Server (Flask)
Speech Recognition (SpeechRecognition library)
Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3)
Sentiment Analysis (TextBlob library)
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
4. Detailed Design
4.1. Web Server (Flask)
File: app.py

Responsibilities:

Handle HTTP requests and responses.
Integrate with speech recognition and sentiment analysis components.
Render HTML templates with dynamic content.
Endpoints:

GET / - Renders the form for input and displays sentiment analysis results if available.
POST / - Processes form submission, performs sentiment analysis, and provides the result.
4.2. Speech Recognition
Library: speech_recognition
Functionality:
Convert spoken input into text using the microphone.
Handle errors and retries for audio recognition.
4.3. Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3)
Library: pyttsx3
Functionality:
Convert text to speech to provide feedback to the user.
4.4. Sentiment Analysis (TextBlob)
Library: TextBlob
Functionality:
Analyze the sentiment of the given text and classify it as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
4.5. Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
File: templates/index.html
Responsibilities:
Provide a user interface for inputting sentences.
Display the results of sentiment analysis.
Use JavaScript for speech recognition integration.
5. Interaction Diagrams
User Interaction Flow:
User opens the web page.
User inputs a sentence or uses speech recognition to input a sentence.
User clicks "Analyze Emotion."
Server processes the input, performs sentiment analysis, and returns the result.
The result is displayed on the webpage.
6. Error Handling
Speech Recognition Errors:

Handle errors by providing user feedback via text-to-speech and re-prompting for input.
Sentiment Analysis Errors:

Handle any unexpected errors in sentiment analysis and provide default feedback if analysis fails.
7. Testing
Unit Testing:

Test each function separately (e.g., speak(), analyze_sentiment()).
Integration Testing:

Test the end-to-end flow from form submission to sentiment display.
User Acceptance Testing:

Verify usability and accuracy with real users to ensure the system meets requirements.
